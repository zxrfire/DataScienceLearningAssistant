    "2. For an example of what we are looking for, please open up \"example.png\". Example.png is the instructor solution, but you are free to use any libraries you are comfortable with. The general idea is to smooth out a plot of datapoints into a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The data you'll be using is inside the current directory, under the name “run.csv”. \"run.csv\" is a dataset with timestamps, longitude, latitude, and heartrate. You'll notice that timestamps are every second.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We would like you to plot the data with the y axis as heart rate and the x axis being the time (not the timestamp, but hours and minutes).\n",

    "5. Plot a line plot of the mean heart rate over a window of 5 minutes with a minimum period of 1.\n"
