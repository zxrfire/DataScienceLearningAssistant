1. We are looking to see if you can solve a data science problem, in particular if you can successfully downsample a time series problem by providing aggregates using pandas and numpy.  
2. The data is inside the binder folder, under the name “run.csv”.
3. We would like you to resample the data with 15 second bins, with the y axis being heart rate and x axis being the time (not the timestamp, but human readable time).
4. For null/missing values in the data, please fill by forwarding the last valid datapoint to the next valid datapoint
5. Perform a rolling window calculation on the data by finding the mean heart rate in bins of 5 minutes with a minimum period of 1 and plot the resulting datapoints
